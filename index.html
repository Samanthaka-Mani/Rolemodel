       <center> <h1><u>My Father Is My Role Model</u></h1></center>
        <p>Many people have role models or people they look up to in their life. It can be anybody, such as a celebrity, super hero, athletes, or just someone you admire. They inspire you and all the decisions you make is a reflection of their character. <strong>My Father is My Role Model </strong>and I will do my best to become a great person like him. He is one of the best people to ever have been in my life. His tenacity, hard work and love are what made me into the person I am today. I would love to take all of his life teachings and advice into consideration so that I can be a great role model for my kids one day.
<br>
            My father is a successful man, and he always tells me about how to be a man, how to succeed in life and how to cherish my time wisely. He has been through a lot of ups and downs in his life, but my father faced these difficulties with great spirit and a strong will, I have learned a lot from him, and this makes my father and I very close. The first thing I admire about my father is his tenacity to get things done.

            My dad has done whatever he could to help me succeed in anything that I was interested in. Whether I needed the latest gadget or set of new clothes my dad would try his best to get those things to me no matter the cost. Even when I was struggling in school he would take his time to help me or help find a tutor for me. There are a lot of parents I know nowadays that would just leave it up to their kids and if they didn’t pass that was the end of the story. I was fortunate enough to have a dad who pushed me to my limits and helped me get through those hard times. There were many times where I would feel overwhelmed and he would just tell me that everything “will be alright”. He was always there for me. My father is a loving and caring person who has always been there for me, no matter what.One of the most important lessons my father has taught me is the value of hard work and perseverance. He has always been a diligent and dedicated worker, putting in long hours to provide for our family and ensure that we have everything we need. <br>I have seen him sacrifice his own comfort and convenience in order to give us a better life, and his work ethic has inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do. Whether it was helping me with my homework, teaching me how to ride a bike, or showing me how to fix a leaky faucet, my father has always been there to support me and encourage me to keep pushing forward, even when things get tough.

            <br>
            <p>My father is a mature and understanding individual who assists me in making important decisions. Like most devoted fathers, he plays a significant role in my life, supporting my career aspirations and helping me overcome daily challenges. When I face difficulties and seek guidance, I instinctively turn to my father. He selflessly puts aside his own priorities to provide the necessary support. He works tirelessly, making countless sacrifices to help me navigate through my problems.   <p> 
                <sup>I am thankful for the impact he has had on me and the person I have become.</sup>

                <h3><i>Why would so many people cherish Fathers!</i></h3>
                We celebrate Father’s Day every year on 19 June to strengthen the relationship and remind a father of the sacrifices he endured towards his kids when they were in need. Unfortunately, it has become a mere formality for many, lacking genuine emotional connection and appreciation. In today’s times, children often choose to live separately from their fathers, prioritizing their own families and disregarding their responsibilities towards their aging fathers, who cling to hope for support.<br>
                
                It is very important that our fathers should be given deep respect and utmost respect not only because they are fathers, but for their unparalleled fatherhood and incredible sacrifices towards us. We must recognize the value of their presence and the impact they have on our lives. By cherishing our fathers, upholding our duties, and expressing gratitude for their sacrifices, we can truly acknowledge the exceptional <del>hero</del>  role models they are in our lives.</p>
